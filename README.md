# test_ofx_blinky
A small openframeworks program to test my ofx_blinky class

## dependencies
* [openframeworks](https://openframeworks.cc) version 0.9.x or higher
* [ofx_blinky](https://github.com/felixdollack/ofx_blinky.git) (is already included as submodule)

## compile
Use the project generator, bundled with openframeworks,
to update the project folder and generate build files
for your system (make, mcvs, xcode, etc).

## Example
After successful compilation, run the executable.
You will see a blue dot in the center of the screen.
After pressing the spacebar the dot will start switching
between a brighter and a darker blue.
Press spacebar again to stop.
